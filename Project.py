*** The dog is hungry - documentation ***

dictionary breeds: list of breeds of dog and related daily amount of food (can be expanded and modified)
dictionary weights: list of possible weights of dog and related daily amount of food (can be expanded and modified)

> Input
param animal_type: the user is prompted to type the type of pet (e.g. dog, cat, mouse etc)
type animal_type: str
param dog_type: the user is prompted to type the breed of the dog (e.g. Golden retriever, Bulldog etc)
type dog_type: str, transformed into capitlized str (to match the key values in the breeds dict)
param dog_weight: the user is prompted to type the weight of the dog
type dog_weight: int
param dog_name: the user is prompted to type the name of the dog
type dog_name: str
param feeding_hours: the user is prompted to type the hours when the dog should be fed. Please separate the hour times with ', '.
                     (e.g. 08:30, 13:30 or 08:30 AM, 04:30 PM etc)
type feeding_hours: str, or list of str if >1 elements
param food_amount: if no breed nor weight is given, then the amount of food must be inserted manually
type food_amount: int

> Functions
function pet_type: checks if the input pet is "dog" (case insensitive), otherwise the program ends, parameter: animal_type
function time_feeding: splits the input str (feeding hours) into the different str hours.
                       checks each str split for the correct format (with regex); transforms each split into datetime format; appends each split
                       to the list (feeding_hours_list)
                       param: feeding_hours
                       correct format of hour to input: hh:mm, hh:mm, hh:mm OR hh:mm AM|PM, hh:mm AM|PM atc
                       param n: lenght of the returned list with hours by time_feeding function
function breed_food: goes through the dictionary with dog breeds and related food amount, to find the correspendent amount
                     param: dog_type
function dog_weight_modulo: rounds the input dog weight to the nearest multiple of 5
                            param: dog_weight
function weight_food: goes through the dictionary with dog weights and related food amount, to find the correspendent amount
                      param: dog_weight
function dog_is_hungry: gets the current time; checks if the current time corresponds to the settled times, only then print out the amoung of food;
                        otherwise exits and say that it's not the right hour
